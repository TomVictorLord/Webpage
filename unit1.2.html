       <h4>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h4>

You could need multiple skills to complete a project which might require multiple people with different expertise and tools.<br> You may need someone good at graphics design, someone good at coding and someone good in making online advertisements for the project.<br> One person might be good at python and another good at Java so you may need more than one person for the job.<br> If multiple people are working on the same code then you might need software so they can upload their work to the cloud and it automatically puts it together between each person contributing to it.<br> Cloud save storages are useful for instantly sending bits of project between each member working on it and also being able to work on it pretty much anywhere you want.<br> Communication is also a big part of what makes projects successful.<br>
